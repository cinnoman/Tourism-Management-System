Tourism management system using data structure concept linked list

Create a file called array.txt to set the initial value of number of tickets. If you want you can extend the number of place in code and also
you need to update the array.txt file. There is an admin panel whose default username is 'admin' & password is 'password'. With all set you are good to go. 

Thank you!
